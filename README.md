# edex_processing_scripts

This is a collection of scripts from Carl used by the edex processing systems.  

Currently manually deployed on edex from master branch but in future auto deployed by the [edex_server cookbook](https://github.alaska.edu/gina-cookbooks/edex_server)

## Developing

* Create branch & hack on new script/fixes
* Update the CHANGELOG unreleased section with your changes
* Create a PR to get a review
* Once reviewed merge PR and bump/tag version in master using `rake version`. See `rake -T` for details.
